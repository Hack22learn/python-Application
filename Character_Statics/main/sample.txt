DOS Attacks or Denial Of Services Attack have become very common amongst Hackers who use them as a path to
fame and respect in the underground groups of the Internet. Denial of Service Attacks basically means denying valid 
Internet and Network users from using the services of the target network or server. It basically means, launching an 
attack, which will temporarily make the services, offered by the Network unusable by legitimate users.
In others words one can describe a DOS attack, saying that a DOS attack is one in which you clog up so much 
memory on the target system that it cannot serve legitimate users. Or you send the target system data packets, which 
cannot be handled by it and thus causes it to either crash, reboot or more commonly deny services to legitimate users.
